# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |

## Security Standards

This project follows industry-standard security practices:

- **OWASP Top 10** compliance for web components
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** alignment
- **SLSA Level 2** build integrity
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** continuous monitoring
- **CIS Controls** implementation

## Vulnerability Management

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Daily**: Dependency vulnerability scanning via Dependabot
- **Weekly**: Full security audit via GitHub Actions
- **Per PR**: Security-focused code review and SAST scanning
- **Release**: Comprehensive security assessment before deployment

### Vulnerability Classification

| Severity | Response Time | Definition |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | Remote code execution, privilege escalation |  
| High | 3 days | Local privilege escalation, information disclosure |
| Medium | 7 days | Limited information disclosure, DoS |
| Low | 30 days | Minor security improvements |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Reporting Method

Send security reports to: **security@terragon.ai**

Include:
- Vulnerability description and impact assessment
- Detailed reproduction steps  
- Proof of concept (if available)
- Suggested remediation approach
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Alternative Reporting

For sensitive disclosures, use our GPG key:
```
Key ID: [TO BE ADDED]
Fingerprint: [TO BE ADDED]
```

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report
2. **Investigation**: Security team investigates within 5 business days  
3. **Coordination**: Work with reporter on disclosure timeline
4. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security patches
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinate public disclosure with security advisory
6. **Recognition**: Credit reporter in security advisory (if desired)

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiry
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- PII data minimization and anonymization

### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Secrets management via environment variables
- Network security with least privilege access
- Regular security updates and patch management

## Compliance & Certifications

### Current Compliance
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy by design
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Security Controls
- Access logging and monitoring
- Incident response procedures
- Business continuity planning
- Regular security training for contributors

## Security Features

### Built-in Security
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection in code repositories  
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) for web components
- Container image vulnerability scanning

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Follow secure coding guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure random number generation

### Development Security
- Enable pre-commit hooks for security scanning
- Never commit secrets, keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper logging without sensitive data exposure
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Review third-party libraries for security issues
- Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools
- Document security-critical dependencies

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions and communicated through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
