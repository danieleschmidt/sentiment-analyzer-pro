# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- **Static Analysis**: `ruff` passes with no style issues.
- **Security Scan**: `bandit` reports two medium severity issues for binding to all interfaces in `cli.py` and `webapp.py` and one low severity issue for a broad exception in `model_comparison.py`.
- **Tests**: `pytest` reports 32 passed and 7 skipped tests.

## Product Manager Review
- Verified that README documents building a Naive Bayes model and the `--lemmatize` flag, fulfilling the documentation task.
- Additional helper functions (`build_nb_model`, `lemmatize_tokens`, `cross_validate`) are exposed in the package API and covered by tests.
- Sprint board items related to these features are marked as done.

Overall the implementation aligns with the development plan and acceptance criteria.
