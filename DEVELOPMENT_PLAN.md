- [x] Create Python virtual environment
- [x] Add `requirements.txt` with base dependencies
- [x] Set up initial project structure as described in `README.md`

## Milestone 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- [x] Gather and clean initial dataset(s)
- [x] Implement text preprocessing module (`src/preprocessing.py`)
- [x] Create unit tests for preprocessing
- [x] Write documentation for data handling

## Milestone 3: Baseline Sentiment Classifier
- [x] Implement baseline model (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression) in `src/models.py`
- [x] Implement training script (`src/train.py`)
- [x] Implement prediction script (`src/predict.py`)
- [x] Add evaluation module (`src/evaluate.py`)
- [x] Write unit tests for model training and prediction

## Milestone 4: Advanced Modeling
- [x] Experiment with RNN/LSTM models
- [x] Explore Transformer-based approaches
- [x] Compare models and record results
- [x] Update documentation with findings

## Milestone 5: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
- [ ] Design approach for aspect extraction
- [ ] Implement aspect-based sentiment component
- [ ] Add tests for aspect-based methods

- [ ] Build simple CLI or web demo for predictions
- [ ] Prepare model for deployment (packaging, Dockerfile, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure continuous integration and automated testing
