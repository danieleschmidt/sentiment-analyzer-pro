# Compliance and Governance Framework

This document outlines the compliance measures, audit procedures, and governance framework for the Sentiment Analyzer Pro project.

## Compliance Standards

### Security Compliance
- **OWASP Top 10**: Regular security scanning with Semgrep and Bandit
- **CIS Controls**: Container hardening and secure configurations
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk assessment and continuous monitoring
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles

### Supply Chain Security
- **SLSA Level 2**: Build provenance and integrity verification
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for all dependencies
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection with Safety and pip-audit
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy security analysis for base images

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy by design principles (if applicable)
- **Data Minimization**: Limited data collection and retention
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit protection
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access management

## Audit Trail and Logging

### Security Events
```yaml
# Monitored security events
events:
  - authentication_attempts
  - authorization_failures
  - data_access_patterns
  - configuration_changes
  - security_scan_results
  - vulnerability_detections
```

### Operational Metrics
- Application performance and availability
- Resource utilization and capacity planning
- Error rates and incident response times
- Deployment frequency and success rates

### Compliance Reporting
- Monthly security scan summaries
- Quarterly dependency audit reports
- Annual risk assessment reviews
- Incident response documentation

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Critical Risks
1. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious dependencies
   - Mitigation: SBOM generation, dependency scanning
   - Monitoring: Automated vulnerability alerts

2. **Container Security**: Vulnerable base images
   - Mitigation: Regular image updates, security scanning
   - Monitoring: Container vulnerability assessments

3. **Data Exposure**: Sensitive information leakage
   - Mitigation: Secrets scanning, access controls
   - Monitoring: Data access audit logs

### Medium Risks
1. **Performance Degradation**: Service availability impact
   - Mitigation: Monitoring and alerting
   - Monitoring: SLA compliance tracking

2. **Configuration Drift**: Security misconfigurations
   - Mitigation: Infrastructure as Code
   - Monitoring: Configuration compliance checks

## Governance Framework

### Code Review Requirements
- Mandatory peer review for all changes
- Security review for sensitive modifications
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Documentation updates for architectural changes

### Release Management
- Semantic versioning for all releases
- Signed commits and tags verification
- Automated security scanning before deployment
- Rollback procedures and incident response

### Access Management
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and deprovisioning
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
- Service account lifecycle management

## Audit Procedures

### Internal Audits
- **Monthly**: Automated security scan reviews
- **Quarterly**: Access controls and permissions audit
- **Bi-annually**: Code quality and technical debt assessment
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security and compliance review

### External Audits
- Third-party security assessments
- Penetration testing (if applicable)
- Compliance certification reviews
- Vendor risk assessments

## Documentation Requirements

### Mandatory Documentation
- [ ] Security risk register
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Data flow diagrams
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Business continuity plans
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures

### Compliance Evidence
- Automated scan reports and remediation
- Security training completion records
- Access review and approval documentation
- Change approval and review records

## Metrics and KPIs

### Security Metrics
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD): < 24 hours
- Mean Time to Response (MTTR): < 4 hours
- Vulnerability remediation time: < 7 days (critical), < 30 days (high)
- Security scan coverage: > 95%

### Operational Metrics
- System availability: > 99.5%
- Performance SLA compliance: > 99%
- Deployment success rate: > 95%
- Test coverage: > 85%

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Security posture assessments
- Compliance gap analysis
- Process optimization opportunities
- Technology stack updates and modernization

### Feedback Loops
- Incident post-mortems and lessons learned
- Stakeholder feedback incorporation
- Industry best practices adoption
- Regulatory requirement updates
