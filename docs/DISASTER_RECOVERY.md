# Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans for the Sentiment Analyzer Pro service.

## Overview

### Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour
- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: 8 hours

### Business Impact Classification
- **Critical**: Core sentiment analysis API (Tier 1)
- **Important**: Model training pipelines (Tier 2)
- **Standard**: Documentation and reporting (Tier 3)

## Disaster Scenarios

### 1. Complete Service Outage
**Scenario**: Primary service becomes unavailable due to infrastructure failure

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Activate incident response team
2. Assess scope and impact of outage
3. Deploy service to backup infrastructure
4. Restore data from latest backup
5. Validate service functionality
6. Communicate status to stakeholders

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 2-4 hours

### 2. Data Corruption or Loss
**Scenario**: Model data, configuration, or application data becomes corrupted

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Stop all write operations to prevent further corruption
2. Assess extent of data loss
3. Restore from most recent clean backup
4. Validate data integrity
5. Resume normal operations
6. Conduct post-incident review

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 1-3 hours

### 3. Security Breach
**Scenario**: Unauthorized access or security compromise detected

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Isolate affected systems immediately
2. Preserve forensic evidence
3. Reset all credentials and access tokens
4. Deploy clean environment from known good state
5. Conduct security assessment
6. Implement additional security measures

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 4-8 hours

### 4. Third-Party Service Outage
**Scenario**: Critical dependencies (cloud services, databases) become unavailable

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Switch to alternative service providers
2. Activate cached/offline mode if available
3. Implement manual workarounds
4. Monitor primary service restoration
5. Gradually restore full functionality

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 1-6 hours (varies by dependency)

## Backup and Recovery Procedures

### Data Backup Strategy
```yaml
backup_schedule:
  models:
    frequency: "daily"
    retention: "90 days"
    location: "encrypted cloud storage"
  
  configuration:
    frequency: "on change"
    retention: "unlimited"
    location: "version control system"
  
  application_data:
    frequency: "hourly"
    retention: "30 days"
    location: "replicated database"

  logs:
    frequency: "continuous"
    retention: "365 days"
    location: "distributed logging system"
```

### Recovery Testing
- **Monthly**: Backup integrity verification
- **Quarterly**: Partial system recovery drill
- **Bi-annually**: Full disaster recovery simulation
- **Annually**: Business continuity exercise

## Infrastructure Resilience

### High Availability Architecture
```yaml
architecture:
  load_balancers:
    - primary: "cloud provider LB"
    - backup: "secondary region LB"
  
  application_servers:
    - minimum: 2
    - auto_scaling: true
    - multi_region: true
  
  databases:
    - replication: "active-passive"
    - backup_region: true
    - point_in_time_recovery: true
  
  monitoring:
    - health_checks: "continuous"
    - alerting: "24/7"
    - escalation: "automated"
```

### Failover Procedures
1. **Automatic Failover**: Health check failures trigger automatic switching
2. **Manual Failover**: Operations team can force failover when needed
3. **Failback**: Controlled return to primary systems after recovery

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communications
- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates response efforts
- **Technical Team**: Implements recovery procedures
- **Management**: Provides resources and business decisions
- **Communications Team**: Manages external messaging

### External Communications
- **Status Page**: Real-time service status updates
- **Email Notifications**: Stakeholder alerts and updates
- **API Responses**: Service degradation indicators
- **Social Media**: Public incident acknowledgment if needed

### Communication Templates
