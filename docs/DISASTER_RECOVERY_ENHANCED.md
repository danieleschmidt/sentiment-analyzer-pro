# Restore from backup
restore_database() {
    echo "Starting database recovery..."
    kubectl apply -f k8s/database-recovery.yaml
    wait_for_recovery
    validate_data_integrity
}

# Validation procedures
validate_data_integrity() {
    echo "Validating data integrity..."
    python scripts/validate_data.py --thorough
    pytest tests/integration/test_data_integrity.py
}
```
