## 1. Introduction

Sentiment analysis has emerged as one of the most important applications in natural language processing, with widespread applications in business intelligence, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis. Traditional approaches rely on classical machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, logistic regression, and more recently, deep neural networks including transformer-based models.

Recent advances in quantum computing have opened new possibilities for machine learning algorithms. Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to potentially achieve computational advantages over classical methods. While fault-tolerant quantum computers remain elusive, near-term quantum devices and quantum-inspired classical algorithms have shown promise in various domains.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Quantum-Inspired Architecture Overview

Our quantum-inspired sentiment classifier consists of four main components:

```
Text Input → Transformer Embeddings → Classical Preprocessing → Quantum Circuit → Classification
```

**Component Details:**

1. **Transformer Bridge**: Extracts dense embeddings using pre-trained models (DistilBERT)
2. **Wavelet-Quantum Hybrid**: Applies wavelet transforms and PCA for dimension reduction
3. **Variational Quantum Circuit**: Processes features through parameterized quantum gates
4. **Measurement & Classification**: Maps quantum states to sentiment predictions

### 3.2 Variational Quantum Circuit Design

Our quantum circuit implements a parameterized ansatz with the following structure:

#### 3.2.1 Data Encoding

We implement two encoding strategies:

**Amplitude Encoding**: Text embeddings are normalized and encoded as quantum state amplitudes:
```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|i⟩, where αᵢ = embedding[i] / ||embedding||
```

**Angle Encoding**: Features are encoded as rotation angles:
```
|ψ⟩ = ⊗ⱼ cos(θⱼ/2)|0⟩ + sin(θⱼ/2)|1⟩, where θⱼ = feature[j]
```

#### 3.2.2 Variational Layers

Each variational layer consists of:

1. **Single-qubit rotations**: RX(θ), RY(φ), RZ(λ) gates on each qubit
2. **Entangling operations**: CNOT gates creating quantum correlations
3. **Parameter updates**: Classical optimization of rotation angles

The circuit depth and qubit count are configurable, allowing exploration of different quantum resources.

#### 3.2.3 Measurement

Classification is performed by measuring the expectation value of the Pauli-Z operator on the first qubit:
```
prediction = ⟨ψ(θ)|Z₀|ψ(θ)⟩
```

### 3.3 Classical Preprocessing Pipeline

#### 3.3.1 Transformer Embeddings

We utilize pre-trained transformer models to extract semantic representations:

- **Model**: DistilBERT-base-uncased (66M parameters)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 768 → configurable reduction
- **Pooling Strategy**: CLS token representation

#### 3.3.2 Wavelet Transform

Wavelet decomposition provides multi-resolution analysis of embedding features:

```python
coeffs = pywt.dwt(embedding, wavelet='haar')
features = concatenate([coeffs[0], coeffs[1]])  # Approximation + Detail
```

#### 3.3.3 Principal Component Analysis

PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving variance:

- **Target Dimensions**: Configurable (default: 64)
- **Variance Preservation**: >95% of original variance retained
- **Computational Efficiency**: Enables quantum circuit simulation

### 3.4 Training Procedure

#### 3.4.1 Objective Function

We minimize the mean squared error between quantum predictions and sentiment labels:

```
L(θ) = (1/N) Σᵢ (yᵢ - ⟨ψᵢ(θ)|Z₀|ψᵢ(θ)⟩)² + λ||θ||²
```

Where:
- θ: Variational parameters
- yᵢ: True sentiment labels (+1 positive, -1 negative)
- λ: Regularization parameter

#### 3.4.2 Optimization

Classical optimization using BFGS algorithm:

- **Learning Rate**: Adaptive based on gradient magnitude
- **Convergence Criteria**: Gradient norm < 10⁻⁶ or max iterations reached
- **Parameter Initialization**: Random uniform [0, 2π]
