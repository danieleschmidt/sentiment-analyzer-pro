# ADR-001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-27

## Context
We need a systematic way to document architectural decisions for the Sentiment Analyzer Pro project to ensure:
- Historical context for future developers
- Transparent decision-making process
- Consistency in architectural choices
- Learning from past decisions

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the format proposed by Michael Nygard:

1. **Title**: Short descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
3. **Date**: When the decision was made
4. **Context**: The circumstances that led to this decision
5. **Decision**: What we decided to do
6. **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural choices
- Better onboarding for new team members
- Historical context for future modifications
- Improved decision-making process

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Need to maintain ADRs as architecture evolves
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not maintained

## Implementation
- ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` directory
- Use sequential numbering: `001-`, `002-`, etc.
- Include ADRs in code reviews for architectural changes
- Reference ADRs in relevant code comments where appropriate
