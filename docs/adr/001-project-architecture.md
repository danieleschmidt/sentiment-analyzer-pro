# ADR-001: Project Architecture and Technology Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a robust architecture for the sentiment analysis toolkit that supports multiple model types, provides both CLI and web interfaces, and maintains high code quality standards.

## Decision
We will adopt a modular, plugin-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Architecture Decisions:
1. **Modular Design**: Separate modules for CLI, web API, preprocessing, models, and evaluation
2. **Plugin System**: Model factory pattern for easy addition of new model types
3. **Configuration Management**: Centralized config with Pydantic validation
4. **Multiple Interfaces**: Both CLI and REST API for different use cases

### Technology Stack:
- **Python 3.9+**: Modern Python with type hints and async support
- **scikit-learn**: Proven ML library for traditional algorithms
- **transformers/torch**: State-of-the-art transformer models
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for API endpoints
- **pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Clear separation of concerns enables easier maintenance
- Plugin architecture allows easy extension with new models
- Multiple interfaces serve different user needs
- Strong typing and validation reduce runtime errors

### Negative:
- Additional complexity in initial setup
- Multiple optional dependencies may complicate deployment
- Plugin system requires careful interface design

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Design**: Rejected due to poor maintainability
2. **FastAPI**: Considered but Flask chosen for simplicity
3. **PyTorch Lightning**: Considered but deemed overkill for current scope
