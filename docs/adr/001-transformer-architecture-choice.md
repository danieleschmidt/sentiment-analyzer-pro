# ADR-001: Transformer Architecture Choice for Sentiment Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The sentiment analyzer requires state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining reasonable performance. Traditional models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) provide fast inference but limited accuracy, while modern transformer models offer superior performance at the cost of computational complexity.

Key considerations:
- Model accuracy requirements for production use
- Inference latency constraints
- Resource utilization (memory, compute)
- Training time and data requirements
- Deployment complexity

## Decision

Adopt a hybrid approach supporting both traditional and transformer-based models:

1. **Primary Models**: DistilBERT for production sentiment analysis
   - Balances accuracy with performance
   - 60% smaller than BERT with 97% performance retention
   - Reasonable inference latency for real-time applications

2. **Baseline Models**: Maintain traditional models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
   - Fast inference for high-throughput scenarios
   - Lightweight deployment options
   - Baseline comparison and fallback options

3. **Optional Advanced Models**: Support for full BERT and custom transformer configurations
   - Maximum accuracy for specialized use cases
   - Research and experimentation capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose models based on their accuracy/performance requirements
- **Future-proof**: Architecture supports emerging transformer models
- **Development velocity**: Established transformer libraries (Hugging Face) accelerate development
- **Accuracy**: Significant improvement over traditional models for complex sentiment analysis

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional dependencies and model management complexity
- **Resource requirements**: Higher memory and compute requirements for transformer models
- **Training time**: Longer training cycles for transformer models
- **Deployment size**: Larger model artifacts and container images

### Mitigation Strategies
- Optional dependencies for transformer models to keep base installation lightweight
- Model caching and optimization for inference performance
- Comprehensive documentation for deployment options
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring tools
