# ADR-002: Python ML Technology Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-27

## Context
We need to choose a technology stack for our sentiment analysis toolkit that balances:
- Performance and accuracy
- Development velocity
- Community support and ecosystem
- Deployment flexibility
- Maintenance burden

## Decision
We will use Python as our primary language with the following core dependencies:

### Core ML Stack
- **Scikit-learn**: Classical ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning models (LSTM, RNN)
- **PyTorch + Transformers**: State-of-the-art transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT)
- **NLTK**: Natural language processing utilities
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Data manipulation and numerical computing

### API and Web Stack
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for REST API
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **PyJWT**: JWT token handling for authentication

### Development Stack
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Language Alternatives
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Rejected due to limited ML ecosystem
- **Java**: Rejected due to verbose syntax and slower development
- **R**: Rejected due to limited deployment options

### ML Framework Alternatives
- **JAX**: Rejected due to steeper learning curve
- **Apache Spark**: Rejected as overkill for current scale
- **MLX**: Rejected due to limited ecosystem maturity

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rich ecosystem of ML libraries and tools
- Strong community support and documentation
- Easy integration between different ML frameworks
- Excellent development velocity
- Good deployment options (Docker, cloud platforms)

### Negative
- Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits threading performance
- Runtime performance slower than compiled languages
- Dependency management complexity with ML libraries
- Memory usage can be high with large models

## Implementation Notes
- Use optional dependencies for heavy ML libraries (torch, tensorflow)
- Provide graceful degradation when advanced libraries are not available
- Use virtual environments and pinned dependencies for reproducibility
- Implement comprehensive error handling for missing dependencies
