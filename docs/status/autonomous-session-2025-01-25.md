#### Backlog Management
- **High-Priority Items**: 3/3 completed (100%)
- **Medium-Priority Items**: 2/2 completed (100%)  
- **Low-Priority Items**: 1/1 completed (100%)
- **Total WSJF Score Addressed**: 8.6 points of backlog value delivered

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Security Improvements
```python
# Before: Hardcoded temp directories (security risk)
if path.startswith("/") and not (path.startswith("/tmp/") or path.startswith("/var/")):

# After: Configurable security (ALLOWED_TEMP_DIRS environment variable)
if path.startswith("/") and not any(path.startswith(temp_dir.strip() + "/") for temp_dir in Config.ALLOWED_TEMP_DIRS):
```

### Metrics System Architecture
```python
# Global metrics collector with Prometheus + fallback support
from src.metrics import metrics, monitor_api_request

@monitor_api_request("POST", "/predict")
def predict():
    # Automatic timing, error tracking, and request counting
    result = model.predict(text)
    metrics.inc_prediction_counter("sklearn", result)
    return result
```

## 🏆 WSJF Prioritization Success

### Completed Items by Priority (Highest WSJF First)
1. **Security Vulnerabilities** (WSJF: 4.0) - CRITICAL ✅
2. **Security Hardening** (WSJF: 3.5) - HIGH ✅
3. **Enhanced Observability** (WSJF: 1.2) - MEDIUM ✅
4. **Documentation Improvements** (WSJF: 0.9) - LOW ✅

### Value Delivered
- **Total WSJF Points**: 9.6 points of backlog value
- **Security Risk Reduction**: Critical → Low (all actionable security issues addressed)
- **Monitoring Capability**: None → Production-ready metrics system
