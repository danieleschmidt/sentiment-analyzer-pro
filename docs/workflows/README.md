# Workflow Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines GitHub Actions workflows that should be manually configured for this repository.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Triggers**: Pull requests, pushes to main
**Actions**:
- Run `make test` (pytest with coverage)
- Run `make lint` (ruff linting) 
- Run `make security` (bandit security scan)
- Python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

### 2. Security Scanning
**File**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`
**Triggers**: Schedule (weekly), manual dispatch
**Actions**:
- CodeQL analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection (detect-secrets)

### 3. Release Automation  
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
**Triggers**: Version tags (v*)
**Actions**:
- Build package with `make build`
- Run full test suite
- Create GitHub release
- Publish to PyPI (if configured)

## Manual Setup Required

Due to permission restrictions, these workflows must be created manually by repository administrators.

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Restrict pushes to main branch

### Repository Settings
- Enable security alerts
- Configure dependency scanning
- Set up environment secrets for deployments
